### A little bit about us
â€“ _How to plant a tree without a shovel? You don't know? Well, we do!_

It's simple: just open our Telegram MiniApp, choose your new green friend, and we'll plant it for you! And how will you know that we planted it? As soon as the tree is planted, you will receive a special NFT certificate with the exact geographical coordinates of your tree and its photo. Also, you'll always be able to see how much oxygen your trees have produced

â€“ _And thatâ€™s it?_

Of course not! You can also plant exclusive trees in parks with your plaque, fruit trees in plantations that will even bring profit, and even plant trees just by playing games! And our promotions and events won't let you get bored. Doing good for the planet is easy, join us! ðŸŒ¿
